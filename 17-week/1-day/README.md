## Python vs JavaScript Demo!
- This week is really not about learning new concepts, its learning how we do things we already know how to do in JavaScript
- Some things will look very similar to JS
- Letâ€™s look at some code!


## Python Setup:
1. Python Install
    - Use the [python-setup.md](https://github.com/appacademy/unified-setup/blob/main/python-setup.md) in the repo linked in a/A Open
2. Explore the basics of Python syntax & data types

---

## Installation walkthrough
- Install Pyenv
- Configure shell environment for Pyenv by updating startup scripts
    - Windows users need to install some extra dependencies for Python
- Install Python (using Pyenv)
- Install Pipenv
    - Don't worry about this - we'll get to it next week!

## Verifying your Python install

1. The following commands should return the same Python 3.9.4+ version:
```
python --version
python3 --version
```
2. `which python` should return `~/.pyenv/shims/python`
